### **Understanding Access Modes and StorageClasses in Non-Cloud Kubernetes**

In Kubernetes, **storage management** is critical for applications that require persistent data. When working in non-cloud environments such as on-premises or bare-metal clusters, understanding **access modes** and **StorageClasses** is essential for configuring storage effectively. This guide explains access modes and how to set up manual StorageClasses for common storage solutions like NFS and local storage.

---

### **Kubernetes Access Modes**

Access modes define how a volume can be mounted by pods. These modes are essential for ensuring that storage behaves as expected based on the application's needs.

#### **1. ReadWriteOnce (RWO)**  
- **Description**: The volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node.  
- **Use Case**: Ideal for single-instance applications, such as a database running on one node.  
- **Limitation**: Only one pod on one node can write to the volume.

#### **2. ReadOnlyMany (ROX)**  
- **Description**: The volume can be mounted as read-only by multiple nodes.  
- **Use Case**: Suitable for workloads that require access to shared, static data, such as configuration files or logs.  
- **Limitation**: No pod can modify the data.

#### **3. ReadWriteMany (RWX)**  
- **Description**: The volume can be mounted as read-write by multiple nodes.  
- **Use Case**: Best for shared storage scenarios, such as distributed file systems or collaborative workloads.  
- **Limitation**: Requires a storage backend that supports simultaneous access (e.g., NFS, Ceph).

#### **4. ReadWriteOncePod (RWOP)**  
- **Description**: The volume can be mounted as read-write by a single pod, even if other pods are on the same node.  
- **Use Case**: Suitable for scenarios requiring strict isolation for a single pod.  
- **Limitation**: Limited support and typically used with CSI drivers.

### **What is a StorageClass?**

A **StorageClass** in Kubernetes defines how storage resources are provisioned. It abstracts the storage backend configuration, making it easier to manage storage across different environments. In cloud environments, StorageClasses enable **dynamic provisioning**. However, in non-cloud setups, they are often used with **manual provisioning**, where Persistent Volumes (PVs) are created in advance.

---

### **Setting Up Manual StorageClass in Non-Cloud Kubernetes**

For non-cloud environments, two common storage solutions are **NFS** and **local storage**. Hereâ€™s how to set up manual StorageClasses for these scenarios.

---

### **1. Manual StorageClass for NFS**

NFS is widely used in non-cloud environments for its ability to provide shared storage across multiple nodes.

#### **Step 1: Define the StorageClass**
Create a manual StorageClass that refers to NFS storage.

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: nfs-manual
provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
```

- **`provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner`**: Indicates that the StorageClass does not support dynamic provisioning.
- **`volumeBindingMode: Immediate`**: Ensures the PV will bind to a PVC as soon as it is created.

#### **Step 2: Create a Persistent Volume (PV)**
Manually create a PV that refers to an exported NFS path.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: nfs-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: nfs-manual
  nfs:
    path: /exported/path
    server: 192.168.1.100
```

#### **Step 3: Create a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)**
Create a PVC that uses the manual NFS StorageClass.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: nfs-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
  storageClassName: nfs-manual
```

This setup ensures that the NFS storage is available for pods with shared read-write access.

---

### **2. Manual StorageClass for Local Storage**

Local storage leverages physical disks or directories on nodes, making it ideal for high-performance workloads or single-node setups.

#### **Step 1: Define the StorageClass**
Create a manual StorageClass for local storage.

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: local-storage
provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```

- **`volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer`**: Delays PV binding until a pod using the PVC is scheduled. This ensures the volume is allocated to the correct node.

#### **Step 2: Create a Persistent Volume (PV)**
Manually create a PV that refers to a directory on a specific node.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: local-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 50Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: local-storage
  local:
    path: /mnt/disks/ssd1
  nodeAffinity:
    required:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
            - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
              operator: In
              values:
                - node-1
```

- **`local.path`**: Specifies the directory on the node where the data is stored.
- **Node Affinity**: Ensures the PV is bound only to the specified node.

#### **Step 3: Create a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)**
Create a PVC that uses the local storage StorageClass.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: local-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 50Gi
  storageClassName: local-storage
```

This setup ensures that the local storage is reserved for a pod scheduled on the specific node.

### **Conclusion**

In non-cloud Kubernetes environments, setting up manual StorageClasses for NFS and local storage provides flexibility and control over storage resources. While these configurations require manual intervention, they are highly effective for on-premises clusters where dynamic provisioning is not available. By combining access modes with manual StorageClasses, you can tailor storage solutions to meet the specific needs of your applications.
