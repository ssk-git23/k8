# **Kubernetes CronJob Tutorial**

## **Introduction to CronJobs**

A **CronJob** in Kubernetes is used to schedule jobs that run periodically, similar to the cron utility in Linux. It is perfect for automating repetitive tasks like backups, data cleanup, or sending periodic emails.

### **Use Cases for CronJobs**
- Database backups every night at midnight.
- Sending periodic reports (e.g., usage statistics).
- Cleaning up temporary files or logs.
- Rotating secrets and certificates.

## **What is a Kubernetes CronJob?**
A CronJob creates **Jobs** at specified times based on a cron schedule. Each **Job** is responsible for running one or more Pods to complete a specific task.

### **Key Features**
1. **Time-based Scheduling**: Uses cron format (`minute hour day month weekday`).
2. **Retries**: Supports retry policies for failed Jobs.
3. **Concurrency Policies**:
   - `Allow`: Allow multiple Jobs to run simultaneously.
   - `Forbid`: Ensure only one Job is running at a time.
   - `Replace`: Cancel the current running Job and replace it with a new one.
4. **Retention Policy**: Control how many old Jobs are kept.

## **Example: A CronJob Running Every 5 Minutes**

This example demonstrates a CronJob that logs the current date and time to showcase its periodic nature.

### **YAML Definition**

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: hello-cronjob
  namespace: default
spec:
  schedule: "*/5 * * * *" # Every 5 minutes
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: hello
            image: busybox
            args:
            - /bin/sh
            - -c
            - date; echo "Hello from Kubernetes CronJob!"
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
  successfulJobsHistoryLimit: 3 # Retain 3 successful Jobs
  failedJobsHistoryLimit: 1     # Retain 1 failed Job
```

---

### **Explanation of YAML**
- **`schedule`**: Defines the cron schedule (`*/5 * * * *`) to run every 5 minutes.
- **`jobTemplate`**: Contains the specification for the Job that will be created.
  - **`containers`**: Runs the `busybox` image with a simple shell command to print the date and a message.
  - **`restartPolicy`**: Set to `OnFailure` to retry if the Job fails.
- **`successfulJobsHistoryLimit`** and **`failedJobsHistoryLimit`**: Control how many old Job records are kept.

### Explanation of schedule: "*/5 * * * *":

```Uses cron syntax to specify that the job should run every minute.
Cron Fields:
┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7)
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *

```

## **Deploy the CronJob**

### Step 1: Create the CronJob
Apply the YAML definition:
```bash
kubectl apply -f cronjob.yaml
```

### Step 2: Verify the CronJob
List CronJobs in the cluster:
```bash
kubectl get cronjobs
```
Expected output:
```
NAME           SCHEDULE      SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
hello-cronjob  */5 * * * *   False     0        <none>          1m
```

### Step 3: Check Jobs Created by the CronJob
After 5 minutes, check the Jobs created by the CronJob:
```bash
kubectl get jobs
```
Expected output (after a few minutes):
```
NAME                       COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
hello-cronjob-123abc       1/1           10s        5m
hello-cronjob-456def       1/1           8s         10m
```

### Step 4: View Pod Logs
View the logs of a Pod created by the Job:
```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```
Expected output:
```
Mon Dec  2 12:35:00 UTC 2024
Hello from Kubernetes CronJob!
```

## **Advantages of CronJobs**
1. **Automation**: Simplifies repetitive and time-based tasks.
2. **Reliability**: Retries failed Jobs based on policies.
3. **Scalability**: Integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes resources.
4. **Efficiency**: Retains historical data for auditing and debugging.

| **Feature**               | **Description**                                                   |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scheduling**            | Time-based jobs using cron syntax.                               |
| **Retries**               | Retries failed Jobs based on `restartPolicy`.                   |
| **Concurrency Policies**  | Control whether Jobs run simultaneously or replace each other.   |
| **History Limits**        | Configure how many old Jobs (successful/failed) are retained.    |

## **Use Cases for CronJobs**
1. Scheduled backups of databases or volumes.
2. Cleaning up old logs or temporary files.
3. Sending periodic alerts or metrics.
4. Automating certificate renewals.
