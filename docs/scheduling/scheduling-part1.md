# **Kubernetes Scheduler: A Comprehensive Guide**

This tutorial explores Kubernetes scheduling, covering the Scheduler's core concepts, the scheduling framework, and its components. You'll also learn about node selection, and how pods are allocated, with enough technical depth to understand and utilize the Kubernetes Scheduler effectively.

## **Introduction to Kubernetes Scheduler**

The **Kubernetes Scheduler** is a core control plane component responsible for assigning pods to suitable nodes within the cluster. It evaluates constraints and conditions to find the best node where the pod can run.

### **Scheduler Overview**
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Identify pods without assigned nodes.
  - Evaluate available nodes against scheduling policies.
  - Bind pods to the most suitable nodes.
  
- **Key Inputs**:
  - Pod specification.
  - Cluster state (nodes, resources, taints/tolerations, etc.).

## **Scheduling Frameworks**

The Kubernetes Scheduler uses a **modular and pluggable framework** to support complex scheduling use cases. This framework enables extending or customizing scheduling behaviors.

### **Key Phases of Scheduling Framework**:
1. **PreFilter**: Checks whether the pod is eligible for scheduling.
   - Example: Resource requests and limits, Pod affinity/anti-affinity.
2. **Filter**: Filters out nodes that cannot run the pod.
   - Example: Node taints, pod tolerations, and node selectors.
3. **Score**: Scores nodes based on their suitability.
   - Example: Least resource usage, locality to existing pods.
4. **Reserve**: Temporarily reserves resources for the pod.
5. **Permit**: Optionally validates scheduling decisions.
6. **Bind**: Binds the pod to the selected node.

## **Kube-Scheduler**

The **Kube-Scheduler** is the default implementation of the Kubernetes Scheduler. It runs as a standalone process in the Kubernetes control plane.

### **Features of Kube-Scheduler**:
1. **Extensibility**:
   - Allows custom plugins via the scheduling framework.
2. **Support for Policies**:
   - Node affinity, taints, tolerations, etc.
3. **Prioritization**:
   - Ensures efficient resource utilization.

### **How the Kube-Scheduler Works**:
1. Watches for unassigned pods.
2. Evaluates nodes using predefined scheduling algorithms.
3. Assigns pods to the most suitable nodes.

## **Node Selection in Kubernetes Scheduler**

Node selection is a crucial part of scheduling. It involves filtering and scoring nodes to identify the best fit for a pod.

### **Key Factors for Node Selection**:
1. **Node Conditions**:
   - Nodes must be "Ready" and schedulable.
2. **Resource Availability**:
   - Nodes must have sufficient CPU, memory, and other resources.
3. **Node Affinity/Anti-Affinity**:
   - Specify nodes the pod should prefer or avoid.
4. **Taints and Tolerations**:
   - Control whether a pod can tolerate node-specific conditions.
5. **Topology Spread Constraints**:
   - Ensure even distribution of pods across failure domains (zones, racks).

## **Working on Pod Allocation**

Pod allocation is the final stage of scheduling, where the selected node is bound to the pod.

### **Steps in Pod Allocation**:
1. **Pod Admission**:
   - Ensure the pod complies with the cluster’s policies.
2. **Node Scoring**:
   - Use scoring plugins to rank nodes.
3. **Node Binding**:
   - Assign the pod to the chosen node.

### **Common Constraints in Pod Allocation**:
- **Resource Requests and Limits**: 
  - Ensure nodes can accommodate the pod’s CPU and memory requirements.
- **Pod Affinity/Anti-Affinity**:
  - Influence where pods are placed based on proximity to other pods.

## **Hands-On Example: Scheduling a Pod**

Here is an example demonstrating how the scheduler assigns a pod using node affinity and tolerations.

### **Node Configuration**
Label a node:
```bash
kubectl label nodes node1 disktype=ssd
```

Taint the node:
```bash
kubectl taint nodes node1 key=value:NoSchedule
```

### **Pod YAML with Scheduling Constraints**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: scheduling-demo
spec:
  tolerations:
  - key: "key"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "value"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: "disktype"
            operator: "In"
            values:
            - "ssd"
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
```

### Steps:
1. Apply the pod manifest:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
   ```
2. Check the pod’s node:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -o wide
   ```

Expected output:
```
NAME             READY   STATUS    NODE    AGE
scheduling-demo  1/1     Running   node1   2m
```

2. Allocating specific workloads to nodes with specialized hardware.
3. Enforcing policies like taints and tolerations for isolating workloads.
