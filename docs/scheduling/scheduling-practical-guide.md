## **1. Kubernetes Scheduler and Advanced Scheduling**

### **1.1 Scheduler Overview**
**What is it?**  
The Kubernetes Scheduler is a control plane component responsible for assigning pods to nodes in a cluster. It evaluates resource requirements, constraints, and policies to determine the best node for a pod.

**Why is it important?**  
Efficient scheduling ensures workload balance, optimal resource utilization, and compliance with constraints like node affinity or taints.

**When to use it?**  
The Scheduler is always active, but tuning it is crucial for large-scale clusters or complex workloads requiring custom scheduling behavior.

---

### **1.2 Scheduler Performance Tuning**
**What is it?**  
Scheduler performance tuning involves optimizing parameters such as the number of scheduling threads, cache size, and timeout values to handle large workloads efficiently.

**Why is it important?**  
A tuned Scheduler minimizes pod scheduling latency and increases throughput, especially in clusters with high pod churn or thousands of nodes.

**When to use it?**  
- High-throughput environments with frequent pod creations.
- Clusters experiencing scheduling delays.

**Example**: Increase the number of scheduling threads for better performance.
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: kube-scheduler
  namespace: kube-system
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: kube-scheduler
        image: k8s.gcr.io/kube-scheduler:v1.27.0
        args:
        - --scheduler-threads=32
```

---

### **1.3 Scheduling Policies**
**What is it?**  
Scheduling policies define rules and constraints that guide the Scheduler in placing pods on specific nodes.

**Why is it important?**  
Policies help achieve specific goals, such as workload isolation, affinity to certain zones, or avoiding nodes with taints.

**When to use it?**  
- To co-locate related workloads for performance benefits.
- To segregate workloads across failure domains for fault tolerance.

**Examples**:
- **Node Affinity**: Place a pod on a node in the "us-east" zone.
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: pod-with-affinity
  spec:
    affinity:
      nodeAffinity:
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          nodeSelectorTerms:
          - matchExpressions:
            - key: "zone"
              operator: In
              values:
              - "us-east"
    containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx
  ```
- **Taints and Tolerations**:
  - Taint a node:
    ```bash
    kubectl taint nodes node1 dedicated=production:NoSchedule
    ```
  - Tolerate the taint in a pod spec:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: pod-with-toleration
    spec:
      tolerations:
      - key: "dedicated"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "production"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
    ```

---

### **1.4 Scheduling Profiles**
**What is it?**  
Scheduling Profiles allow you to define different scheduling strategies for various workloads within the same cluster.

**Why is it important?**  
They enable flexibility by letting you customize Scheduler plugins for specific use cases, such as GPU workloads or latency-sensitive applications.

**When to use it?**  
- In mixed-use clusters with diverse workload requirements.
- When specific scheduling behaviors are necessary for certain workloads.

**Example**: Customize Scheduler profiles for general and GPU workloads.
```yaml
apiVersion: kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: KubeSchedulerConfiguration
profiles:
- schedulerName: "default-scheduler"
  plugins:
    score:
      enabled:
      - name: NodeResourcesFit
- schedulerName: "gpu-scheduler"
  plugins:
    filter:
      enabled:
      - name: NodeResourcesFit
    score:
      enabled:
      - name: NodeAffinity
```

### **1.5 Topology Management Policies**
**What is it?**  
Topology management ensures optimal resource allocation across NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) nodes for performance-critical applications.

**Why is it important?**  
It improves performance by minimizing latency caused by resource misalignment, especially for hardware-sensitive workloads.

**When to use it?**  
- Applications requiring high throughput or low latency.
- Workloads benefiting from NUMA-aware scheduling.

**Example**: Configure the Kubelet for strict topology alignment.
```yaml
apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: KubeletConfiguration
topologyManagerPolicy: "restricted"
```

---

### **1.6 Pod Topology Spread Constraints**
**What is it?**  
These constraints distribute pods across failure domains (e.g., zones, racks) to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

**Why is it important?**  
It reduces the risk of failure impacting all replicas of an application by spreading them across multiple nodes or zones.

**When to use it?**  
- To enhance fault tolerance for critical applications.
- In multi-zone or multi-rack clusters to prevent single points of failure.

**Example**: Spread pods across zones.
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: spread-demo
spec:
  replicas: 6
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: demo
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: demo
    spec:
      topologySpreadConstraints:
      - maxSkew: 1
        topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
        whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: demo
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
```

## **2. Kubernetes Resource Management**

### **2.1 Pod Overhead**
**What is it?**  
Pod Overhead accounts for additional resource usage caused by Kubernetes components, such as the container runtime or network overlay.

**Why is it important?**  
Accurately reflects the actual resource consumption of a pod, preventing overcommitment and ensuring node stability.

**When to use it?**  
- When using sidecar containers or custom runtimes.
- For detailed resource accounting in resource-constrained clusters.

**Example**: Use RuntimeClass to enable overhead accounting.
```yaml
apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
kind: RuntimeClass
metadata:
  name: overhead-runtime
handler: runsc
overhead:
  podFixed:
    cpu: "100m"
    memory: "50Mi"
```

---

### **2.2 Resource Requests and Limits**
**What is it?**  
Requests and limits define the minimum and maximum resources a pod can use.

**Why is it important?**  
They ensure fair resource distribution, prevent overuse, and avoid resource contention between workloads.

**When to use it?**  
- To guarantee resources for critical workloads.
- To control resource usage in multi-tenant environments.

**Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: resource-managed-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "256Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
      limits:
        memory: "512Mi"
        cpu: "1"
```

---

### **2.3 Resource Quotas**
**What is it?**  
Resource Quotas limit the total CPU, memory, or storage a namespace can consume.

**Why is it important?**  
Prevents any single namespace from consuming disproportionate resources, ensuring balanced usage in multi-tenant clusters.

**When to use it?**  
- In multi-tenant clusters with resource caps.
- To enforce organizational resource policies.

**Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: namespace-quota
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "2"
    requests.memory: 2Gi
    limits.cpu: "4"
    limits.memory: 4Gi
```

---

### **2.4 Limit Ranges**
**What is it?**  
Limit Ranges enforce minimum and maximum resource constraints for pods and containers.

**Why is it important?**  
It standardizes resource usage, avoiding extreme under or over-allocation.

**When to use it?**  
- For predictable workload performance.
- To enforce consistent resource policies.

**Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: container-limits
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  limits:
  - max:
      memory: "1Gi"
      cpu: "1"
    min:
      memory: "128Mi"
      cpu: "200m"
    type: Container
```

---

### **2.5 Pod Priority and Preemption**
**What is it?**  
Pod Priority determines the order of scheduling during resource contention. High-priority pods can preempt lower-priority pods.

**Why is it important?**  
Ensures critical workloads receive resources during shortages.

**When to use it?**  
- For system-critical or latency-sensitive applications.
- In resource-constrained clusters.

**Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: scheduling.k8s.io/v1
kind: PriorityClass
metadata:
 

 name: high-priority
value: 1000
globalDefault: false
description: "Priority for critical workloads"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: high-priority-pod
spec:
  priorityClassName: high-priority
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```
