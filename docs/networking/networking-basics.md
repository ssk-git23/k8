# Networking Basics for Beginners

## Section 1: Understanding Networking Fundamentals

### **1. What is Networking?**

Networking refers to the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources, such as data, applications, or hardware. It is the backbone of communication in modern computing systems and is essential for distributed systems like Kubernetes.

### **2. Key Components of a Network**

- **IP Addresses**: Unique identifiers assigned to devices on a network to enable communication.
  - **IPv4**: Uses a 32-bit address format (e.g., `192.168.1.1`). It supports approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.
  - **IPv6**: Uses a 128-bit address format (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`). It provides a virtually unlimited address space and improves routing efficiency and security.

- **CIDR Blocks (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**: A method to define IP address ranges more efficiently. CIDR uses a notation like `192.168.1.0/24`, where `/24` indicates the number of bits used for the network prefix, allowing flexible subnetting.

- **Ports**: Logical endpoints that help identify specific applications or services running on a device.

- **Protocols**: Rules for communication between devices. Key protocols include:
  - **HTTP/HTTPS**: Used for web traffic.
  - **TCP/UDP**: Transport layer protocols for reliable (TCP) and fast, connectionless (UDP) communication.
  - **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses.

### **3. Types of Networks**

- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: A network confined to a small area, like an office or home.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: A network that spans large geographic areas, like the internet.
- **Virtual Networks**: Software-defined networks created within systems like cloud environments or Kubernetes clusters.

### **4. Key Concepts in Networking**

- **Subnets**: Smaller sections of a larger network, each with a unique range of IP addresses.
- **Routing**: The process of determining how data moves from one device to another across networks.
- **Firewalls**: Security systems that monitor and control incoming and outgoing traffic.
- **Load Balancers**: Distribute traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability and reliability.

### **5. Networking in a Distributed System**

Distributed systems rely heavily on networking to enable communication between services, applications, and users. In such systems, concepts like microservices, service discovery, and network policies are critical.

### **6. Tools and Commands for Networking Basics**

- **Ping**: Tests connectivity between two devices.
- **Traceroute**: Shows the path data takes to reach a destination.
- **Netstat**: Displays network connections, routing tables, and more.
- **Curl**: A command-line tool for testing HTTP/HTTPS requests.

## Section 2: Linux Networking Basics

### **1. Network Interfaces**

- **Physical Interfaces**:
  - `eth0`, `eth1`, etc.: Represent physical network interfaces connected to the system.
  - `lo`: The loopback interface used for internal communication on the host, typically with the IP `127.0.0.1`.

- **Virtual Interfaces**:
  - Interfaces like `veth` (virtual Ethernet) are commonly used in containerized environments.
  - Bridges such as `br0` connect multiple interfaces at Layer 2, enabling communication between virtual machines or containers.

### **2. Essential Networking Commands**

- `ip addr`:
  - Displays or modifies IP addresses and properties of network interfaces.
  - Example: `ip addr show` shows all interfaces and their assigned IPs.

- `ip route`:
  - Displays or modifies the routing table.
  - Example: `ip route add default via 192.168.1.1` sets the default gateway.

- `ifconfig` (deprecated):
  - Previously used to configure interfaces; replaced by `ip` commands.

- `ping`:
  - Tests connectivity to another device using ICMP packets.

- `traceroute`:
  - Displays the route packets take to reach a destination.

- `netstat`:
  - Displays network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics.

- `tcpdump`:
  - Captures and analyzes network packets for troubleshooting.

### **3. Linux Networking Features**

- **Bridge Networking**:
  - A software bridge like `brctl` connects multiple interfaces, acting as a virtual switch.
  - Commonly used in Docker and Kubernetes to enable container communication.

- **Host Networking**:
  - Containers or virtual machines share the host’s network stack.
  - Used for performance or direct access to host interfaces.

- **Network Namespaces**:
  - Isolate network stacks for different processes or containers.
  - Each namespace has its own interfaces, routes, and rules.

### **4. IP Address Management**

- **Dynamic IP Assignment**:
  - DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) automatically assigns IPs to devices.

- **Static IP Assignment**:
  - Configuring fixed IPs in `/etc/network/interfaces` or equivalent configuration files.

### **5. Networking in Containers**

- **Container Network Models**:
  - **Bridge Mode**: Containers share a bridge network with NAT.
  - **Host Mode**: Containers use the host’s network directly.
  - **None Mode**: No networking; useful for isolating containers.

- **Docker Networking**:
  - Default bridge network connects containers with private IPs.
  - Custom networks allow more control over communication and IP allocation.

### **6. Practical Networking Scenarios**

- **Troubleshooting Connectivity**:
  - Use `ping`, `traceroute`, or `curl` to verify connections.
  - Check interface statuses with `ip addr` or `ethtool`.

- **Packet Capture**:
  - Use `tcpdump` or Wireshark to inspect traffic for debugging.

- **Firewall Rules**:
  - Configure `iptables` or `firewalld` to allow or restrict traffic.

## Section 3: Kubernetes Networking Basics

### **1. Networking in Kubernetes**

Kubernetes networking enables communication between containers, Pods, and external resources. It abstracts complex networking configurations, making it easier for applications to function seamlessly.

### **2. Container Networking Modes**

- **Bridge Mode**:
  - Containers connect through a bridge network and communicate using NAT.
- **Host Mode**:
  - Containers share the host’s network stack for direct access to the host’s interfaces.
- **None Mode**:
  - Containers are isolated and do not use any network interface by default.

### **3. Pod Networking**

- Pods in Kubernetes are assigned unique IP addresses within the cluster.
- Pods communicate directly with each other across nodes without NAT.
- The IP range for Pods is defined in the cluster CIDR, typically configured during cluster setup.
  - Example: `10.244.0.0/16` for many Kubernetes CNI plugins like Flannel.

### **4. Service Types**

- **ClusterIP**:
  - Default service type. Exposes the service within the cluster with a virtual IP.
- **NodePort**:
  - Exposes the service on a static port on each cluster node.
- **LoadBalancer**:
  - Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer.
- **ExternalName**:
  - Maps a service to an external DNS name.

### **5. Endpoints and EndpointSlices**

- **Endpoints**:
  - Represent the IP addresses and ports of Pods backing a Service.
  - Example: When a Service is created, Kubernetes automatically manages the associated Endpoints.
- **EndpointSlices**:
  - A more scalable way to represent endpoints.
  - Reduces the size of resource objects when dealing with many endpoints.

### **6. Network Policies**

- Define rules to control the traffic flow between Pods.
- Use labels to specify the source and destination Pods.
- Example: A policy can allow traffic only from specific namespaces or Pods.

### **7. Ingress and Egress**

- **Ingress**:
  - Manages external access to services in a cluster, typically HTTP/HTTPS.
  - Example: An Ingress controller like NGINX routes traffic to specific Services based on rules.
- **Egress**:
  - Controls outgoing traffic from Pods.

### **8. Tools for Kubernetes Networking**

- **kubectl get svc**:
  - Lists services and their cluster IPs and ports.
- **kubectl get pods -o wide**:
  - Shows Pods along with their IPs and node assignments.
