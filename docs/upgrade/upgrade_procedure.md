# Summary of Steps for Kubernetes Upgrade

## Backup Before the Upgrade
1. **Backup etcd Data:**
   - etcd contains the cluster state and must be backed up before performing the upgrade.
   - Use the following steps to create an etcd snapshot:
     - **Set environment variables** for etcd access:
       ```bash
       export ETCDCTL_API=3
       export ETCDCTL_ENDPOINTS=https://127.0.0.1:2379
       export ETCDCTL_CACERT=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt
       export ETCDCTL_CERT=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt
       export ETCDCTL_KEY=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key
       ```
     - **Save a snapshot:**
       ```bash
       sudo etcdctl snapshot save /path/to/backup/etcd-snapshot.db
       ```
     - **Verify the snapshot:**
       ```bash
       sudo etcdctl snapshot status /path/to/backup/etcd-snapshot.db
       ```
2. **Back up manifests and configuration files:**
   - Save important files such as static pod manifests and `/etc/kubernetes` configurations.

## Upgrade the Control Plane
1. **Prepare for the upgrade:**
   - Update the system package lists and verify the target Kubernetes version.
2. **Upgrade kubeadm:**
   - Install the target `kubeadm` version and check compatibility.
3. **Apply the upgrade plan:**
   - Use `kubeadm` to upgrade the control plane components (API server, controller-manager, and scheduler).
4. **Drain the control plane node:**
   - Safely evict workloads to prepare the node for the upgrade.
5. **Upgrade kubelet and kubectl:**
   - Install the matching versions of `kubelet` and `kubectl` to align with `kubeadm`.
6. **Restart and verify the control plane:**
   - Restart services and confirm that the control plane node is operational.

## Upgrade the Worker Nodes
1. **Prepare the worker nodes:**
   - Update the package lists and ensure the correct `kubeadm` version is installed.
2. **Upgrade the node configuration:**
   - Use `kubeadm` to upgrade each worker node configuration.
3. **Drain the worker nodes:**
   - Safely evict workloads to minimize disruption.
4. **Upgrade kubelet and kubectl:**
   - Install the new versions of `kubelet` and `kubectl` to match the control plane version.
5. **Restart and uncordon the worker nodes:**
   - Restart services and bring the node back into the cluster.
6. **Verify the node status:**
   - Ensure that the worker nodes are upgraded and in a `Ready` state.

## Validate the Upgrade
1. **Check cluster health:**
   - Verify that all control plane and worker nodes are in a `Ready` state.
2. **Deploy a test workload:**
   - Run a test pod (e.g., an NGINX pod) to confirm application deployments.
3. **Check cluster components:**
   - Ensure all system components (like DNS, networking, and storage) are healthy.
4. **Verify networking and workloads:**
   - Test pod-to-pod communication and network connectivity.
5. **Clean up test resources:**
   - Remove temporary workloads and ensure the cluster remains stable.

## Rollback if the Upgrade Fails
If an upgrade fails, rolling back to the previous state is critical:
1. **Restore etcd Snapshot:**
   - Stop the kubelet service:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl stop kubelet
     ```
   - Restore the etcd snapshot:
     ```bash
     sudo etcdctl snapshot restore /path/to/backup/etcd-snapshot.db --data-dir /var/lib/etcd
     ```
   - Restart etcd and kubelet services.
2. **Downgrade Kubernetes Components:**
   - Reinstall the previous versions of `kubeadm`, `kubelet`, and `kubectl`.
3. **Verify Cluster State:**
   - Ensure that all components and workloads are running as expected.

## Version Skew Policy Considerations
- **Kubeadm and Kubernetes Components:**
   - `kubeadm` only supports upgrades **one minor version at a time**.
   - For example, an upgrade from v1.27 to v1.29 requires upgrading to v1.28 first.
- **Control Plane vs Worker Nodes:**
   - Worker nodes can lag by **one minor version** behind the control plane version.
- **kubelet and API Server:**
   - The kubelet version must **not exceed** the API Server version.

### Summary of Version Skew:
| Component               | Supported Skew           |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Control Plane -> Nodes  | Nodes can lag by 1 minor |
| API Server -> Kubelet   | Kubelet can lag by 1 minor |
| Client -> API Server    | kubectl can lag by 1 minor |

## Additional Considerations
- **Staging Environment:** Always test upgrades in a staging environment before applying to production.
- **Monitoring Tools:** Use monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to detect post-upgrade issues.
- **Audit Logs:** Check Kubernetes logs for anomalies during and after the upgrade.
- **Cloud-Specific Differences:** For managed Kubernetes services (EKS, AKS, GKE), consult the cloud provider's documentation for any additional steps.

## Final Summary
This high-level guide outlines the steps required for a successful Kubernetes upgrade:
1. **Backup:** Protect cluster state with etcd snapshots and backups.
2. **Upgrade the Control Plane:** Sequentially upgrade `kubeadm`, `kubelet`, and `kubectl`.
3. **Upgrade the Worker Nodes:** Upgrade nodes one at a time to minimize disruption.
4. **Validation:** Verify the cluster health, workloads, and networking.
5. **Rollback:** Be prepared to restore etcd and downgrade components if needed.
6. **Version Skew:** Ensure all components comply with the Kubernetes version skew policy.

By following these steps, you can perform reliable Kubernetes upgrades with minimal downtime while safeguarding cluster stability.
