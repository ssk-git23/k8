#### 6.1 Configure and Verify Nginx Deployment

Follow the steps to configure and deploy an Nginx application in Kubernetes.

1. **Create a Configuration File for Nginx Deployment:**
   - Create a file `nginx.yaml` for your Nginx deployment:
     ```bash
     vi nginx.yaml
     ```

   2. **Insert the Nginx Deployment Configuration:**
      Insert the following YAML configuration:
      ```yaml
      apiVersion: apps/v1
      kind: Deployment
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: nginx
        name: nginx
      spec:
        replicas: 1
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            app: nginx
        template:
          metadata:
            labels:
              app: nginx
          spec:
            containers:
            - image: nginx
              name: nginx
      ```

   3. **Create the Nginx Deployment:**
      ```bash
      kubectl create -f nginx.yaml
      ```

   4. **Verify the Deployment and Pod Status:**
      ```bash
      kubectl get deployments
      kubectl get pods
      ```

   5. **View the Logs of the Nginx Pod:**
      ```bash
      kubectl logs nginx-7854ff8877-mvrtr
      ```

---

#### 6.2 Tainting Worker Nodes and Deployment Failures

1. **Taint the Worker Node:**
   - Taint the worker node to prevent any pods from being scheduled on it:
     ```bash
     kubectl taint nodes worker-node-1 key=value:NoSchedule
     ```

2. **Check Deployment Status:**
   - After tainting the node, check the status of the deployment and pods:
     ```bash
     kubectl get deployments
     kubectl get pods
     ```
     **Expected Outcome:** The pod(s) will not be scheduled, and the deployment will not reach the "READY" state.

3. **Troubleshooting the Issue:**
   - To resolve the issue, you can either:
     - Remove the taint from the node:
       ```bash
       kubectl taint nodes worker-node-1 key=value:NoSchedule-
       ```
     - Or, you can add a toleration in your Nginx deployment YAML to allow the pod to be scheduled on tainted nodes:
       ```yaml
       spec:
         template:
           spec:
             tolerations:
             - key: "key"
               operator: "Equal"
               value: "value"
               effect: "NoSchedule"
       ```

---

#### 6.3 Troubleshooting Incorrect Image Names

1. **Use an Incorrect Image Name:**
   - Modify your `nginx.yaml` to use a non-existent image (e.g., `nginx:wrongtag`):
     ```yaml
     containers:
     - image: nginx:wrongtag
       name: nginx
     ```

2. **Check the Pod Status:**
   - After applying the deployment with the incorrect image, check the pod status:
     ```bash
     kubectl get pods
     ```

   **Expected Outcome:** The pod will be stuck in `ImagePullBackOff` or `ErrImagePull` status.

3. **Troubleshoot the Image Pull Error:**
   - To troubleshoot, you can describe the pod to get more information:
     ```bash
     kubectl describe pod nginx-7854ff8877-mvrtr
     ```
     Look for error messages related to the image pull. In this case, it will indicate that the image does not exist.

4. **Fix the Issue:**
   - Update the deployment YAML to use the correct image tag:
     ```yaml
     containers:
     - image: nginx:latest
       name: nginx
     ```

   - Apply the changes:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f nginx.yaml
     ```

   - Verify the pod status:
     ```bash
     kubectl get pods
     ```

---

#### 6.4 Pod and Container Status Issues and Fixes

Here are some common pod and container status issues you may encounter, along with troubleshooting steps and fixes.

1. **Pod Status: CrashLoopBackOff**
   - **Cause:** The container within the pod repeatedly crashes (often due to application errors).
   - **Troubleshooting:**
     ```bash
     kubectl describe pod <pod_name>
     kubectl logs <pod_name>
     ```
     - Look for error messages in the logs and investigate the container's behavior.
   - **Fix:** Modify the deployment YAML or the container configuration to fix the application errors. You might need to adjust resource limits, environment variables, or code.

2. **Pod Status: Pending**
   - **Cause:** The pod cannot be scheduled because there are not enough resources available.
   - **Troubleshooting:**
     ```bash
     kubectl describe pod <pod_name>
     ```
     - Check the events section for resource allocation issues.
   - **Fix:** Ensure that the node has enough resources (CPU, memory) or scale up your cluster if necessary.

3. **Pod Status: Terminating**
   - **Cause:** The pod is stuck in the `Terminating` state due to an issue with the deletion process (e.g., finalizers not completing).
   - **Troubleshooting:**
     ```bash
     kubectl get pod <pod_name> -o yaml
     ```
     - Check for the `finalizers` field and any associated issues.
   - **Fix:** Force delete the pod if necessary:
     ```bash
     kubectl delete pod <pod_name> --force --grace-period=0
     ```

4. **Container Status: Waiting (Reason: ContainerCreating)**
   - **Cause:** The container is waiting for necessary resources or dependencies.
   - **Troubleshooting:**
     ```bash
     kubectl describe pod <pod_name>
     ```
     - Check the events section for more information on why the container is stuck in this state.
   - **Fix:** Ensure the required resources (e.g., images, volumes) are available and accessible.

5. **Container Status: Running (but Application is Not Responding)**
   - **Cause:** The container is running, but the application inside it is not behaving as expected (e.g., not starting, crashing).
   - **Troubleshooting:**
     ```bash
     kubectl logs <pod_name> -c <container_name>
     kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -- /bin/bash
     ```
     - Use the logs and interactive shell to investigate the application inside the container.
   - **Fix:** Modify the application configuration, fix any application-level issues, or redeploy the pod.

## Section 7: Understanding Application Troubleshooting

In this section, you will learn how to set up a Kubernetes application pod, diagnose potential issues, and implement corrections to ensure successful deployment and smooth operation of the application.

---

#### 7.1 Setup and Diagnose the Application Pod

This section outlines the steps to create a pod, verify its state, diagnose issues, and apply fixes.

1. **Create the Application Pod Deployment:**

   1.1 **Create the `issue-pod.yaml` File:**
   - Draft the following YAML code to create a pod and save it in a file called `issue-pod.yaml`:
     ```bash
     vi issue-pod.yaml
     ```
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Pod
     metadata:
       name: openshift
       labels:
         Podlabel: ckacourse
     spec:
       containers:
       - name: mycontainer
         image: docker.io/openshift
         ports:
         - containerPort: 80
     ```
     **Objective:** To create a Kubernetes pod for troubleshooting application issues.

2. **Deploy the Pod:**

   1.2 **Create the Pod:**
   - Deploy the `issue-pod.yaml` file to the Kubernetes cluster:
     ```bash
     kubectl create -f issue-pod.yaml
     ```

3. **Verify the Pod Status:**

   1.3 **Check the Pod Status:**
   - To verify if the pod is running correctly, use the following command:
     ```bash
     kubectl get pods
     ```
     **Expected Outcome:** The pod may be stuck in a `Pending`, `CrashLoopBackOff`, or `ContainerCreating` state, indicating an issue.

4. **Retrieve Events and Pod Details:**

   1.4 **Check Events for Errors:**
   - To diagnose any cluster-wide or pod-specific issues, view the events:
     ```bash
     kubectl get events
     ```

   1.5 **Describe the Pod:**
   - To get detailed information about the pod and potential error messages, use:
     ```bash
     kubectl describe pod openshift
     ```

   **Expected Outcome:** You may encounter errors in the `Events` section, such as image pull errors, insufficient resources, or other configuration issues.

---

#### 7.2 Troubleshooting the Application Pod

Once you have diagnosed the issue with the pod, the next step is to troubleshoot and resolve it.

1. **Change the Container Image:**

   1.6 **Edit the Pod's Service Image:**
   - If the issue is related to an incorrect image, edit the pod definition to change the container image. For example, change the image from `docker.io/openshift` to `openshift/helloopenshift`:
     ```bash
     kubectl edit pod openshift
     ```
     - This will open the pod configuration in your default editor. Update the image field as follows:
       ```yaml
       image: openshift/helloopenshift
       ```

2. **Verify Changes to the Pod:**

   1.7 **Confirm the Changes:**
   - After editing the pod, check the pod status to confirm that it is now running:
     ```bash
     kubectl get pods
     ```
     **Expected Outcome:** The pod should now be in the `Running` state if the issue has been resolved.

---

#### 7.3 Common Pod Troubleshooting Scenarios

Here are some common pod-related issues you may encounter, along with troubleshooting steps and fixes.

1. **Pod Status: CrashLoopBackOff**
   - **Cause:** The container inside the pod repeatedly crashes, often due to an application issue (e.g., missing dependencies, incorrect configurations).
   - **Troubleshooting:**
     ```bash
     kubectl describe pod openshift
     kubectl logs openshift
     ```
     - Look for errors in the logs and the `Events` section of the description.
   - **Fix:** Modify the container's configuration, fix the application issue, or update the container image.

2. **Pod Status: ImagePullBackOff or ErrImagePull**
   - **Cause:** The container image is either incorrect or unavailable.
   - **Troubleshooting:**
     ```bash
     kubectl describe pod openshift
     ```
     - Look for error messages related to the image pull.
   - **Fix:** Ensure the correct image name and tag are used in the pod configuration. Update the pod definition if needed:
     ```bash
     kubectl edit pod openshift
     ```

3. **Pod Status: Pending**
   - **Cause:** The pod cannot be scheduled due to insufficient resources or other node issues.
   - **Troubleshooting:**
     ```bash
     kubectl describe pod openshift
     kubectl get nodes
     ```
     - Check for resource allocation issues (e.g., memory, CPU) in the pod description and node status.
   - **Fix:** Adjust the resource requests and limits in the pod configuration, or scale the cluster to accommodate the pod.

4. **Pod Status: Terminating**
   - **Cause:** The pod is stuck in the `Terminating` state due to issues with resource cleanup or finalizer blocks.
   - **Troubleshooting:**
     ```bash
     kubectl get pod openshift -o yaml
     ```
     - Look for any hanging finalizer blocks preventing the pod from terminating.
   - **Fix:** Force delete the pod if necessary:
     ```bash
     kubectl delete pod openshift --force --grace-period=0
     ```

5. **Container Status: Waiting (Reason: ContainerCreating)**
   - **Cause:** The container is waiting for necessary resources (e.g., storage or network connectivity) or dependencies.
   - **Troubleshooting:**
     ```bash
     kubectl describe pod openshift
     ```
     - Check for any missing resources or dependencies in the `Events` section.
   - **Fix:** Ensure that the required resources (such as persistent volumes or network configurations) are available.

#### 7.4 Additional Troubleshooting Tools

1. **Use `kubectl logs -f` to Follow Logs in Real-Time:**
   - If your pod is running but the application inside it is not responding, follow the logs to monitor its output:
     ```bash
     kubectl logs -f openshift
     ```

2. **Use `kubectl exec` to Access the Container:**
   - To further diagnose an issue, you can access the container and interact with it:
     ```bash
     kubectl exec -it openshift -- /bin/bash
     ```
     This allows you to troubleshoot the application from inside the pod.

By following these steps, you will be able to set up a Kubernetes pod, diagnose any issues, and apply fixes to resolve problems that may arise during deployment. These troubleshooting techniques are essential for ensuring that your Kubernetes applications run smoothly.

## Section 8: Handling Component Failure Threshold

In this section, you will learn how to check the health of your Kubernetes cluster, including the nodes and overall cluster health status, and how to diagnose issues that may arise due to component failures.

---

#### 8.1 Check the Cluster Health Information

This section outlines the steps to gather information about the health of the cluster, including nodes and configuration.

1. **Check the Nodes in the Cluster:**

   1.1 **View Cluster Nodes:**
   - To get detailed information about the nodes in the cluster, execute the following command:
     ```bash
     kubectl get nodes
     ```
     **Objective:** To view the list of nodes in the cluster, their status, and health. This provides an overview of the cluster's node-level health.

   **Expected Outcome:**
   - The command should display the nodes along with their status (e.g., `Ready`, `NotReady`), version, and other relevant details.
   
   Example output:
   ```bash
   NAME              STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
   worker-node-1     Ready    <none>   5d    v1.20.0
   worker-node-2     NotReady <none>   5d    v1.20.0
   master-node-1     Ready    master   5d    v1.20.0
   ```

2. **Dump Cluster Information and Check Health:**

   1.2 **Generate and View Cluster Health Dump:**
   - To get a comprehensive collection of diagnostic information about the cluster's health, use the following commands:
     ```bash
     kubectl cluster-info dump > dump.json
     vi dump.json
     ```
     **Objective:** To gather detailed cluster configuration, resource usage, and status in a JSON file for further analysis.

   **Expected Outcome:**
   - The `dump.json` file contains a wealth of information, including details about nodes, pods, namespaces, and cluster components, which can be used for diagnosing potential failures.

   Example:
   - The contents of `dump.json` will include details like:
     - Cluster configuration
     - Node and pod status
     - Component health (e.g., API server, controller manager, scheduler)
   
   **Tip:** Use `vi` or any text editor to search through the file for any error or warning messages regarding component health.

3. **Interpret Cluster Health Information:**

   - After obtaining the cluster dump, you may encounter different failure scenarios:
     - **Component Failure:** If the dump contains error logs or `NotReady` status for critical components (e.g., API server, controller manager), further investigation is needed.
     - **Node Failures:** Nodes marked as `NotReady` might indicate issues such as resource exhaustion, network partitioning, or configuration issues.

4. **Addressing Node Failures:**

   - If a node is in the `NotReady` state, use the following to investigate further:
     ```bash
     kubectl describe node <node-name>
     ```
     This command provides detailed information on the node’s condition, including events that may indicate why it is not in a `Ready` state.

By following these steps, you can successfully gather diagnostic information about your Kubernetes cluster, enabling you to identify and resolve issues related to node health, component failures, or configuration errors. Regularly checking cluster health is essential for maintaining a highly available and reliable Kubernetes environment.
